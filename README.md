## What Are Annual Accounts? 📚  
Annual accounts are the financial statements every UK company must prepare at the end of their financial year. These include:  
- **Profit and Loss Statement**: Shows your company’s performance.  
- **Balance Sheet**: Summarizes assets and liabilities.  
- **Notes to Accounts**: Provides details about your accounts.  

Tax4UK ensures your **[annual accounts](https://www.tax4uk.com/services/annual-accounts-ct600.html)** are prepared accurately and submitted on time, helping you comply with Companies House regulations. ✅

The CT600 form is your company’s **Corporation Tax Return**, required by HMRC. It contains:  
- Details of your company’s profits or losses.
